This repo contains the code used for Yanny's 2025 honours project 

Training LUCIE on SpeedyWeather's primitive wet equation to study applications of TLM's generated from LUCIE's neural network.


1. Run SpeedyWeather simulation to get Reanalysis 

2. Clean Reanalysis to retrieve states in the domain of LUCIE 

3.
